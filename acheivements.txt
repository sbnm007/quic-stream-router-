2) TLS Decryption in Wireshark to view encryoted payload data


QUIC Stream Router with Wireshark Decryption
You successfully implemented a TLS key logging system for QUIC (HTTP/3) traffic, allowing you to decrypt and analyze QUIC communications in Wireshark. Here's what you accomplished:
1. TLS Key Logging Implementation
Modified the aioquic library to log TLS 1.3 session keys to a file
Configured both client and server to use secrets_log_file for logging keys
Created a line-buffered key log file that Wireshark can use for decryption
2. QUIC HTTP/3 Infrastructure
Built a QUIC proxy server that routes HTTP/3 streams to different microservices
Created three separate microservices (video, text, control) running on different ports
Implemented a client that sends test data across multiple streams simultaneously
3. Stream Multiplexing
Successfully multiplexed different data streams over a single QUIC connection
Routed streams to appropriate backend services based on their request paths
Handled bidirectional communication with proper HTTP/3 framing
4. Debugging & Troubleshooting
Resolved compatibility issues with aioquic 0.9.20
Fixed H3Connection implementation to properly handle headers and data events
Implemented stream tracking for proper data routing
5. Wireshark Decryption
Successfully captured QUIC traffic between client and server
Configured Wireshark to use the generated keylog file
Verified decryption by viewing the plaintext data in the captured packets
This implementation provides you with full visibility into encrypted QUIC traffic, which is normally impossible to inspect due to TLS 1.3 encryption, making it an invaluable tool for debugging and analyzing QUIC-based applications.
